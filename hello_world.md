# Hello World from docsplant :rocket:

You might wonder what docplant is all about and who is behind it. This first blog post is intended as a short introduction to me and also docsplant. A lot more is to come, and I am excited to share it with all of you.

So let me introduce myself. I am Tobias. Together with my wife and son, I live in Switzerland in the middle of Europe. I don't give much about job titles or fancy roles, I like to call my self a coder, simple as that. Not that kind of coder that specializes in a specific field or programming language, although I admire the people that have managed to become an expert in their field. I however tend to frequently switch between tools, frameworks, and even programming languages. Even though I should know better by now. But every time I read an interesting blog post, I have the inner compulsion to try it out myself immediately and make it somewhat useful to me.
  
The good thing about this is that I have seen a lo(ooooo)t of different documentation and approached to it. Some boosted my experience, but a lot also drove me nuts or even resulted in me giving up. This made me quickly realizing that the inflection point in most projects tend to be the quality of its up-to-date documentation. And soon happened what had to happen, I became that guy lifting documentation above everything else. For a while I was annoying and even forcing everyone around me to spend more time on documentation and had the feeling that a project fails immediately if not documented to its tiniest little detail. It took me a while, but eventually I understood that there is not always a right or wrong when it comes to documentation, but more a how. I learned that things like budgets, time, and requirements need to balanced out. However, I never doubted a single day that an easy to follow, and especially up-to-date documentation is often the key to success.

Till then, I have tried out a lot of different approaches and enlarged my horizon as much as I could, bringing me to docsplant. My Idea to lower the entry barrier for high quality and easy to maintainable documentation. It's not yet another piece of software that claims to solve all problems with documentation out there, rather I want to build a team that can guide the way, both for companies and for individuals.

I believe some key values for good documentation are:
* Easy to understand (both for the target group, but also for everyone involved in the product).
* Easy to contribute to (Even without a degree in computer science or technical writing).
* Easy to keep up to date.
* Maintainable by more people than just the creator.

If done right, I believe this can be achieved through the philosophy of _Docs as Code_ and the awesome open source projects behind it.
> Documentation as Code (_Docs as Code_) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code.

> ([Eric Holscher](http://ericholscher.com/) & the [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org) community)

One way to do this is through blog posts and tutorials that will be accessible right here for everyone as open source. The other way will be to help and support companies that can not afford a dedicate team of documentation specialists or might not even have it on their radar. This can be as simple as a workshop or a customized roadmap, but also outsourcing parts or the hole documentation stack to docsplant completely. The idea for it was born when I thought about how much easier it would have been for me knowing someone has my back when it comes to documentation. It also would have saved me and my teams from a lot of pitfalls and refactorings.

I know that there are already communities like [Write the Docs](https://www.writethedocs.org) that provide a ton of resources to learn more about excellent documentation and even will answer all of your questions around it. To be honest, without them, I would have never taken the route I am on right now. That's why docsplant is not a replacement for these communities by any means, and you should definitely check them out right after that blog post. Docsplant will rather add to that stack by offering the capabilities of a specialized team of experts that are up-to-date with the latest developments. Starting here in Switzerland and close by countries. So if you are that employee or product owner that feels (or is) responsible for documentation (e.g. APIs, scientific/industrial instruments, â€¦) but would like to have a bit more support, knowledge and ideas, docsplant is for you.

> The focus of docsplant is on open source and offering the best solution for the task not on making money. So even if there is no budged for impactfull documentation we are here to help.

With this quote, I would like to close and encourage you to stay tuned. But more important than that, reach out to us via email at support@docsplant.com or via a [GitHub](https://github.com/docsplant/blog/discussions). Whether you want to how we can boost or support your documentation stack, but also if you have some feedback or ideas.
